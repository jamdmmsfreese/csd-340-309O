        <h1>My Story</h1>
        <h2>Chapter 1: About Me</h2>
        <p class="intro">
            I grew up in the city.  I now live in a suburban area.  The city has grown a lot in the past several years.
        </p>
        <p>
            I went to small private schools growing up.  After high school, I went to work before trying college.  I finally started college 5-years after high school.  <span class="sentence">I finally graduated six years later!</span>  
        </p>
        <p>
            As a child, I enjoyed dancing and running.  In high school, I was on the track team.  I was also a cheerleader.
        </p>
        <p>
            I grew up in a house with two siblings and my parents.  I have many other relatives but they do not live close by.  There are a few that I now pretty well, some a know a little bit, and many I have never met.
